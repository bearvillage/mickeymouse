  <p>Mickey Mouse is an animated character created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks.
    A cheerful anthropomorphic mouse, Mickey made his first public appearance in
    Steamboat Willie, on November 18, 1928. Estimated as standing 2' 3" (68.58 centimeters)
    and weighing 23 pounds (10 kilograms), Mickey is easily identified by his round ears,
    red shorts, white gloves, and yellow shoes. He speaks in a falsetto voice, and his speech
    is typically infused with 1930's slang like "swell" and "gee".</p>
  <p>The essence of Mickey’s character is based around the underdog archetype, most prominently
    illustrated by his small size. In compensation for his stature, Mickey must rely on his
    quick-wit and athleticism to overcome larger-than-life adversity. With characteristics inspired
    by vaudeville comics and swashbucklers from the silent film era, Mickey is depicted as a
    lovable rogue—being bodacious and optimistic, but also mischievous and ungainly.</p>
  <p>Mickey was popularized by his long-running short film series. His simplistic, "rubberhose"
    design allows for both relatable emotion, and exaggerated physical gags. Mickey’s versatility,
    meanwhile, enables him to slip into any profession, location, or time period, while maintaining
    his core characteristics. Mickey steadily branched into other mediums over the years, beginning
    with a comic strip by cartoonist Floyd Gottfredson in 1930. In 1940, Mickey made his feature-length
    film debut with Fantasia, for which he was given his modern redesign by animator Fred Moore. In the
    1950’s, Mickey became a television mainstay with the premiere of The Mickey Mouse Club, as well as
    an icon for the Disney theme parks with the opening of Disneyland. Mickey has also featured prominently
    in critically acclaimed video games such as 1990’s Castle of Illusion and the Kingdom Hearts series.</p>
  <p>With an endearing personality and imaginative cartoons, Mickey rapidly rose to the pinnacle of
    American culture, becoming the most popular and recognizable cartoon character in the world, and the
    prime influence of following cartoons. For all his acclaim, none have viewed Mickey more fondly than
    Walt Disney, himself. The two were widely regarded as "alter-egos" by peers and historians, a perception
    supported by Walt originating Mickey’s voice. Disney once attributed his success to the advent
    of Mickey, famously proclaiming that, “it was all started by a mouse”.</p>
  <p>As its most famous character, Mickey serves as the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. He has appeared
    in over 130 films, for which he received numerous accolades. In 1932, Walt Disney was presented an honorary
    Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. In 1978, Mickey became the first animated character to
    receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His 3-circle silhouette serves as the logo for most of Disney's
    subsidiaries, save for the ones that don't carry the 'Disney' or 'Walt Disney' label.</p>
